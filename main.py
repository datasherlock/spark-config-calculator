                        - These configurations ensure that all the memory is used for executors with the assumption that each executor will consume the requested cores. 
                        - But since you are using `DefaultResourceCalculator`, the container allocation can be done using memory alone leaving CPU sharing to be managed by the OS
                        - You can reduce the `spark.executor.memory` to a smaller value that's more suited to your workload and run another applications concurrently.
                        - This way, Yarn will schedule more executors requested by the next application as long as there is memory available.
                        - Click the revised configurations tab above to tune the executor memory and see the revised configurations based on different values of `spark.executor.memory`
